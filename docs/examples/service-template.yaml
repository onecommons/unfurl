  # The Kubernetes profile comprises capability types, not node types
  # You need to create your own node type that is an assemblage of capabilities
  # In other words, the node is where we logically relate Kubernetes resources together
  Application:
    capabilities:
      # The Metadata capability will be shared with all resources
      # Only one should be used per node type
      metadata: k8s:Metadata
      # Other capabilities can be added to represent Kubernetes resources
      # (The same capability type can be used multiple times, e.g. two LoadBalancer)

    interfaces:
