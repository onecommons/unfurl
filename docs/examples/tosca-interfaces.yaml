    interfaces:
      Standard:  # this is a built-in interface type so the "type" field is not required
        inputs:  
          # inputs defined at this level will be made available to all operations
          foo: bar
        operations:
          # in the simplest case an operation can just be the name of an artifact or shell command

          # a more complex operation:
          configure:
            implementation:
              primary: my_ansible_playbook # name of artifact
              dependencies:

            inputs:
              foo: baz  # overrides the above definition of "foo"
