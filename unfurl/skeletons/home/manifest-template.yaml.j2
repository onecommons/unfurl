# This Ensemble template was generated during creation of your ~/unfurl_home and models
# the local environment Unfurl runs inside of, e.g. the client machine or container,
# its local network, etc.
# It is intended to be included in your ensemble.yaml manifest file
# (by default, found at ensemble/ensemble.yaml)
# You can use it to configure your local environment by adding your own templates
# and deploying it like any other Ensemble.
