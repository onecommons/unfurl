        # # this is an example of a minimal node template

        #   type: unfurl.nodes.Generic
        #   properties:
        #     # Templates need to define the properties declared by its type.
        #     # but unfurl.nodes.Generic is defined to allow its templates to declare
        #     # arbitrary properties, like this one:
        #     name: foo
        #   requirements:
        #     # "dependency" is the base relationship type between nodes
        #     # use it if you want to set untyped dependencies between nodes
        #     - dependency: anotherNode
        #   interfaces:
        #     # you need to define these operations if they are missing from node's type definition
        #     # the operation is defined as a simple string, the implementation is executed as a shell command.
        #     # Jinja2 style templates expressions are supported.
        #     Standard:
        #       # to deploy a node you need to at least define a configure operation
        #       configure: echo "created and configured {{ SELF.name }}"
        #       # if you want to be able to undeploy this node, define a delete operation
        #       delete: echo "deleted {{ SELF.name }}"
        #     Install:
        #       # if you want to be able to check on the status of a deployed node,
        #       # define a check operation
        #       check: echo "{{ SELF.name }} ok"
